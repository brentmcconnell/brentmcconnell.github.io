 mean.

I recently had a customer ask several questions about what IOPS and Max
throughput mean and how they could increase throughput so that their backup
restore process in Azure would take less time. In this post we'll look at how we
can estimate our max throughput and IOPS based on VM size and disk configuration.  
Additionally, we'll also look at ways to improve performance without increasing costs.

## Problem

How can we estimate what our max IOPS and throughput will be in Azure? And how
can we increase IOPS and throughput and perhaps even lower our costs at the
same time to achieve our max IOPS or throughput goals?

## Solution

First, let's start with some basic definitions.  IOPS stands for __input/output
operations per second__. It's a measure of performance for storage devices
that represents how quickly a storage device can read and write data to disk
every second 

Throughput is a bit different but related to IOPS.  Throughput measures the data
transfer rate to and from storage devices per second. Throughput is impacted
by IOPS and the block size being written to disk and is measured, typically,
in MiB/s.

Understanding how IO is throttled to protect both the storage and compute
resources is an important concept to understand when dealing with any cloud
provider.  Cloud providers place IO limits on both storage and VM resources
to help protect resources from workloads that would otherwise cause more
serious issues if left unchecked.  

Each type of VM and storage resource in Azure provides you with Max IOPS
and throughput so that users migrating workloads can estimate if that resource
type can support a particular workload.  

Take the following table on disk speeds in Azure as an example.  This table
clearly identifies the IOPS and max throuhput you can expect for disk types by
size.

*Above tables taken from [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/larger-more-powerful-managed-disks-for-azure-virtual-machines/).

The alert reader will notice that HDD disks are actually faster than SSD disk
for smaller sized disks, however the thing to note about these smaller disks
of both SSD and HDD types are that the performance rate is generally low. Most
advanced users will note that the SSD drives in their laptops can do probably
2-5 times the performance of the Premium SSD drives unless you are provisioning
disks of more than 8TB. However just remember the disks provisioned in Azure
come with SLAs that determine how many copys of the data are written and where
that data is written to.  This type of redundancy doesn't come for free in terms of
IOPS and throughput.

Azure supports several types of storage redundancy.  These are:
* LRS: Locally redundant storage
* ZRS: Zone-redundant storage
* GRS: Geo-redundant storage
* RA-GRS: Read access geo-redundant storage

### Storage Features by Type
![Storage Redundancy](/images/2019-12-20-Azure-IO/redundant.png){:

So now that we've established that there is lots of goodness that comes with
a provisioned disk in Azure let's look at how we can provision a solution
that is cost performant and also provides the necessary level of performance.
Obviously the first task on the punch list is understanding the workload you
are moving and what its requirements are for CPU, memory and IO.  __I see many
cases where customers provision based on CPU and memory and don't look at IOPS
and throughput until much further down the road when they have unexplained
performance problems.__

When determining your overall solution ensure that you are looking not only at
the CPU and memory of a VM but also its max IOPS and throughput as determined by
reviewing the specifications for each [VM type](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/sizes)

The following is an example of 2 VM type specs taken from the Azure website:
General Purpose and Memory Optimized:

![Dsv2-series Limits](/images/2019-12-20-Azure-IO/dsv2.png){:
.align-left .outline}

![Esv3-series Limits](/images/2019-12-20-Azure-IO/esv3.png){:
.align-left .outline}

The column highlighted in red provides you with the max IOPS and throughput this
VM type is capable of performing.  Even if you attach a 32TB Premium SSD capable
of 20,000 IOPS and 900MiB/s, if you choose a Standard_DS3v2 (4CPU and 14GB of
memory) the max IOPS will be 12,800 and max throughput will be 192MiB/s (the
limits of the VM)

## Example

Let's perform some basic benchmarking using Ubuntu 16.04 and an IO tool called
__fio__.  In this first scenario let's look at a DS3v2 with 2 disks attached:

1.  The first disk will have a Premium SSD (P15)
data disk provisioned and attached to it at the /sdc mount point.  This is a
256GB disk capable of 1100 IOPS and 125 MiB/s.  
2.  Disk 2 will be a 2TB Premium SSD (P40) capable of 7500 IOPS and 250 MiB/s.
    This disk will be mounted on /sdd

The following file is used to configure fio for 4 worker threads
```terminal

>> cat fiowrite.ini

```

In this example we are using fio to push throughput (not IOPS) but you can
see we got 121 MiB/s which is close to our rate limit for this disk type
(125MiB/s). We could probably tweak our fio parameters a bit to get a couple
of more MiB but I'll leave that as an exercise for you, the reader, if you're
interested.

Now let's look at the P40 disk we mounted on /sdd with a rate limit of 250MiB/s.

```terminal

Run status group 0 (all jobs):
  WRITE: bw=186MiB/s (195MB/s), 45.4MiB/s-47.9MiB/s (47.6MB/s-50.2MB/s), io=6087MiB (6383MB), run=32215-32750msec

  sdd: ios=0/12194, merge=0/1119, ticks=0/30530848, in_queue=30570116, util=99.36%

```

So now we see that we are limited on the P40 disk to ~190MiB/s.  This is __NOT__
the limit on the disk but the limit on the VM.  We have essentially capped out
at 190 MiB/s even though the disk supports up to 250 MiB/s.

## Software RAID and Saving Money

So in our quick example we needed to provision at least a P30 Premium SSD to be
able to max out our VM's Max throughput of 192MiB/s, however a P30 is $135/month for a 2 TiB
disk whereas a P15 is only $38/month for 256GiB.  If we don't need the full 2
TiB of space but want to increase our Max IOPS and throughput we can use
Software RAID (aka mdraid) on Linux.  Mdraid will allow us to strip disks
together to increase our IOPS, throughput and even redundancy if you want to add
additional layers of redundancy to what is already available in Azure.

In this next example I will use 2 256 GiB/s P15 disks in a RAID 0 configuration
to create a new Linux device called md0.  We'll mount /dev/md0 on the mountpoint
/md0 and run our same test.

Just to recap our disk type quickly a P15 Premium SSD is capable of 1,100 IOPS and
125 MiB/s of throughput.

The previous example created the /dev/md0 device using RAID 0 and mounted in at
/md0. If we run our same fio workload against the /md0 device that contains our
2 P15 disks we should see the performance of the /dev/md0 device allow our VM to
now reach the full max bandwidth of 192 MiB/s.

And there you have it!!!  We reached basically the same bandwidth that we could have
accomplished on a P30 disk with 2 P15 disks using Software RAID (aka. mdadm) on
Linux.  In this simple little example we are able to __save around 45% on our
monthly storage bill__ by using Software RAID so that we didn't have to
overprovision disk to get the throughput we needed!!  

Hope this helps.  Good Luck.
