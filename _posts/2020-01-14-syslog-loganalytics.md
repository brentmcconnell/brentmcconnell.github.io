I was recently tasked with coming up with a solution that enabled several
different types of information related to Azure VMs to be collected and reported
on. Types of information included application logs, operating system logs and
Azure activity logs. Readers of this blog may not know that Azure has a
product called Log Analytics that is similar to Splunk (except for the cost)
that can capture and report on just about any kind of logs you can imagine. In
this post we'll take a look at what goes into getting syslog information into
Log Analytics and then running some basic queries against those logs.

## Problem

How can an Azure user collect syslog information in a central repository
like Log Analytics and write reports and/or get notified of certain operating
system events as they occur?

## Solution

### What is Log Analytics
First, let's look at what [LogAnalytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/log-query/get-st
arted-portal) is and the basics of how we can report from it. Log Analytics is a
service that helps you collect and report against data generated by resources in
Azure or from your on-premises environment. It is a very powerful SaaS offering
from Microsoft that can hold and analyze millions of records using the Kusto
query language. It has a very flexible reporting web-based environment as well
as a full REST API for integration with other tools. An additional benefit of
using Log Analytics is that you can setup monitoring on your data to alert you
when certain log criteria are met which we'll cover in more detail later.

### Create Log Analytics Workspace

The first step in getting useful information from Log Analytics is to create a
Log Analytics workspace in your subscription if you don't already have one.
This can be done using a recent version (2.0.80+) of the Azure CLI with...

```terminal
az monitor log-analytics workspace create \                                                                                                                ✔  10111  14:19:26
    --resource-group example-rg \
    --workspace-name azurevmlogs \
    --location usgovvirginia
```
Once you have created a Log Analytics workspace in your Azure subscription you
can access the data in your workspace by selecting the __Logs__ link in the left
navigation menu. This will give you direct access to the KQL Console for analyzing the collected data.

__Note:  If you just created this workspace it won't contain any data
until we start adding data to it.__

## Collect Azure Activity Data

The first data we will start collecting in Log Analytics is the Azure
Activity Log. The Azure Activity Log is a subscription log that provides detail
about subscription level events. This includes Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
data, service health, service activity (ie. VM start and stops), etc.  The
following table highlights the type of data that will be collected.
![Activity Log Events](/images/2020-01-14-syslog-loganalytics/activity-log.png){:
.shadow .outline}. 

We can start the collection process by selecting the __Azure Activity log__
option in the left menu of your Log Analytics workspace.  Select the appropriate
subscription you want to start collection on and choose the __Connect__ option.
That's it.  You are now streaming data into Log Analytics!  If you perform some
actions in the portal you should see data in Log Analytics.  For instance if you
create a new virtual machine or stop an existing virtual machine you will see
data in the AzureActivity table

Try this in the Query Window under __Logs__.  If you have performed any ARM
actions you should now see some results from the query.

![KQL Results](/images/2020-01-14-syslog-loganalytics/kql-results.png){:
.shadow .outline}. 

Now that we have some basic data in Log Analytics let's add additional detail by
connecting some Linux VMs to our workspace.  There are several different ways to
do this.  You can navigate to your Log Analytics workspace and select __Advanced
settings__.  Here you will find options for connecting various data sources to
the analytics workspace.  If you select __Connected Sources > Linux Servers__
you will find instructions on how to add the Linux agent to your servers and
connect those agents to this workspace.

![Connect Sources](/images/2020-01-14-syslog-loganalytics/data-sources.png){:
.shadow .outline}. 

If you prefer to sit back and direct work from a central location you have 2
options for installing the agent.  The first option is via the Azure CLI.

```terminal
az vm extension set \                                                                                                                                    1 ↵  10119  16:17:47
  --resource-group your-vms-resource-group \
  --vm-name your-vms-name \
  --name OmsAgentForLinux \
  --publisher Microsoft.EnterpriseCloud.Monitoring \
  --version 1.10.1 --protected-settings '{"workspaceKey":"log-analytics-workspace-key-here"}' \
  --settings '{"workspaceId":"log-analytics-workspace-id-here"}'
```

The other option is even easier.  If you navigate to the Log Analytics workspace and select the __Virtual
machines__ option under __Workspace Data Sources__ in the left navigation menu
you'll see all the VMs in the current subscription presented and whether they
are connected to the workspace or not.

![Connect VMs](/images/2020-01-14-syslog-loganalytics/vm-sources.png){:
.shadow .outline}. 

From this screen you can select the VM you want to connect and then simply
select __Connect__ on the next screen.  This will push the omsagent to the Linux
machine and install it while also connecting it to the workspace.

### Collect Syslog Data

So far we've created a Log Analytics workspace and also started capturing some
basic information about Azure Activity in our workspace.  But we want to go a
step further and start loading Syslog data into Log Analytics so we have a central
repository for Linux logs as well as a convenient way to issue queries against
those logs and send alerts when anomolous behavior occurs.

The nice thing about the omsagent is that it is already configured to push Syslog to Log
Analytics it's just needs to be told which syslog facilities you want to send.
If we look at /etc/rsyslog.d/95-omsagent.conf on any of the VMs we configured
with the agent you'll see an empty file.

```terminal
>> cat /etc/rsyslog.d/95-omsagent.conf
# OMS Syslog collection for workspace 123456-xzxzx-5b5b-a35d-2a2byummy47

```

Again we have options for supplying values to this file. We can either push
configuration to this file from the Log Analytics workspace or we can configure
the file locally. In this particular case I'm going to push the configuration
from the UI. The nice thing about using this option is that the configuration
will be pushed to all the agents connected to this workspace without you having
to configure each vm individually. 

If you navigate to your Log Analytics
workspace and select __Advanced settings__ in the left navigation you'll be back
at the screen we viewed previously for information on how to configure the Linux
agents manually. If we select the __Data__ option this time you'll have several
data sources available to choose from for collecting data.

![Syslog Configuration](/images/2020-01-14-syslog-loganalytics/syslog.png){:
.shadow .outline}. 

To push the configuration to your connected Linux agents you will need to enter
the name of the syslog facilities you want to capture and select the __Apply below
configuration to my machines__ option at the top of the page.  __Note: Don't forget to
select Save once you are done__.  Once you've saved your configuration you'll need to wait a few minutes
(usually 5-10 minutes is a safe bet)
for the omsagent to pick up the new configuration and then your Linux logs will
start being pushed to Log Analytics.  

After the configuration defined in the portal is picked up by the omsagent
you'll now have values defined in your /etc/rsyslog.d/95-omsagent.conf file.

```terminal

>> cat /etc/rsyslog.d/95-omsagent.conf
# OMS Syslog collection for workspace 3cf08a73-b0de-4b4b-a35d-2a2b183aa147
auth.=alert;auth.=crit;auth.=emerg;auth.=err;auth.=info;auth.=notice;auth.=warning	@127.0.0.1:25225
authpriv.=alert;authpriv.=crit;authpriv.=emerg;authpriv.=err;authpriv.=info;authpriv.=notice;authpriv.=warning	@127.0.0.1:25225
kern.=alert;kern.=crit;kern.=emerg;kern.=err;kern.=info;kern.=notice;kern.=warning	@127.0.0.1:25225
syslog.=alert;syslog.=crit;syslog.=emerg;syslog.=err;syslog.=info;syslog.=notice;syslog.=warning	@127.0.0.1:25225

```

### Query Syslog
Now that we have our Syslog in Log Analytics we can setup alerts on those logs
so that we can detect anomalous behavior.  Let's start with a query that looks
for odd login behavior.  Using KQL this query will look for "alert" and "crit"
messages and also any "notice" level messages that have FAILED in the
SyslogMessage field.

![Login Errors](/images/2020-01-14-syslog-loganalytics/login-errors.png){:
.shadow .outline} 

And that's it!  We now are seeing any odd login behavior being reported to Syslog from our
Linux VMs.  But let's assume we don't want to run this query manually in order to
determine if we have problematic behavior going on.  We can setup a __Alert__
using this query so that whenever Syslog messages are consumed by Log Analytics
if it detects any returned values for this query we can send an alert.  By
selecting __New alert rule__ at the top of the results page we can setup a rule
for this query.

![Alert](/images/2020-01-14-syslog-loganalytics/alert.png){:
.shadow .outline}. 

Now all we have to do is fill in the information for the alert and we will have
automatic detection and alerts for any unusual user behavior that matches the
query we just executed and this will continue to run as Syslog logs are ingested
into Log Analytics.

### Conclusion
So hopefully this was helpful and you see just how easy it is for Log
Analytics to ingest Syslog files from VMs in your Azure subscription and detect
anomalous behavior.
